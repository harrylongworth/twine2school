# twine-school
Twine 2 based school games

Designed to be edited and managed by the Twine 2 App (twinery.org) which you can do here:
http://twinery.org/2/

Import the index.html file as a story and edit

Initial version has example game and game data which will be removed as development progresses and externalised as imports for the first game (Words)

The initial game "Words" is a simple "words" flashcard viewer that parents and teachers can use to test and drill students with.

It has different word sets for two example students (Jamie and Tom) and example teachers Amy and Harry

It logs results but the results aren't yet "saved" 

You can see the change log and To Do list inside the twine
